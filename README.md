# Library
A university python project :)
It is a library application which a member can sign up and borrow books from.
Also the admin of the app is able to add or remove books without changing books.txt file directly.
There is a simple password generator that generates 8 characters.
RecoverPassword is an executable file, which send an email to the member in case he/she forgot the password. Make sure that it is in the same directory as library.py is.
